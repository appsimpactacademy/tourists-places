  description: "<p class='lead'>Jai Vilas Mahal is a fine example of European architecture. It was designed and built by Lt. Col. Sir Michael Filose (1832-1925),[2] the Chief Secretary and Director of Public Instruction of Gwalior.[3] The palace is a combination of the architectural style of the Mughals and the Medici. It is a combination of architectural styles, the first storey is Tuscan, the second Italian-Doric and the third Corinthian. The area of the Palace is 124,771 square feet and it is known for its large Durbar Hall. The interior of the Durbar Hall is decorated with gilt and gold furnishings and adorned with a huge carpet and gigantic chandeliers. It is 30 metres (100 ft) long, 15 metres (50 ft) wide and 12 metres (41 ft) in height. The palace was described by Sir William Howard Russell in 1877. The Palace covers an area of 124,771 square feet, exclusive of the inner square, which is 321 by 321% feet. The building is double-storied, and the wings and turrets are three- and five-storied. Its total length is 106 feet. The first story is Tuscan, second Italian Doric, and the third Corinthian order of architecture. The interior of the Reception-room is 97 feet 8 inches long by 50 feet broad, and it is 41 feet in height. The roof is arched with stone slabs 21 feet long, which enabled the architect to make the ribs prominent. They rest at each end on double Corinthian columns, which form a colonnade round the interior. The interior and exterior of the Palace form a combination of arcades and colonnades. Upwards of 300,000 leaves of gold were‘used to decorate the Reception-hall. The Grand Staircase-room is roofed with stone slabs 30 feet long; the room opposite to it is roofed in the same way. This room was used for dancing. The length of each of these rooms is 50 feet. The Grand Drawing-room, one of the finest saloons in the world, is hung with wonderful chandeliers, and decorated with enormous mirrors. The Prince's bedstead, washing service, and bath were of solid silver. The cost of the Palace was a little above 1,100,000 rupees. But the garden-walls, iron railings, gardens, furniture, glass, grand staircase, chandeliers, etc, cost about 500,000 rupees more. The area of the garden is about one square mile; there are several waterfalls and a number of fountains in it. A large room preserves the desk and photographs of Madhavrao Scindia, who served as the Railway Minister of India. Many of the rooms, including drawing rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms, have been preserved just as they were lavishly decorated for the royal family.[5] The royal kitchen, with its furnaces, pots, china and other items have also been preserved. Supposedly, eight elephants were suspended from the durbar (royal court) hall ceiling to check it could cope with two 12.5 metres (41 ft)-high, 3.5-tonne chandeliers with 250 light bulbs, said to be the largest pair in the world. Unusual items fill many rooms: cut glass furniture, stuffed tigers and a ladies-only swimming pool with its own boat. The cavernous dining room displays the pièce de résistance, a model silver train that carried after-dinner brandy and cigars around the table.[6][7] In contrast to the western style dining room, a completely Indian style dining room is also preserved, which was used when the Maratha nobles were invited. The museum preserves the memory of the humble origin of Scindia (spelled in Hindi/Marathi Shinde) from the Kanherkhed village in Maharashtra. The family left its ancestral village in 1726, however it has continued to preserve its Maratha heritage. On special occasions, the Scindia family members still wear the Maratha style (Shineshahi pagdi) turban which uses 60 metres (200 ft) of Chanderi silk, with pointed ends. An exhibit at the museum explains the intricate steps involved in wrapping the special turban.</p>",

The twin temples are situated in the Gwalior Fort.[4][2]. The temple's tower and sanctum has been destroyed, but its architecture and damaged carvings can still be appreciated from the ruins. The jagati platform is 100 feet (30 m) long and 63 feet (19 m) wide, on a square plan.[2] The temple was three-storeyed, which was one of its distinguishing features and sophistication. It followed a central cluster concept, states Adam Hardy.[5] The surviving elements of the temple are the entrance porch and the mandapa.[2] According to James Harle, though the prasada (tower, spire) no longer exists, the triple storey plan with a cruciform foundation and balconies suggests that it had a North Indian Bhumija style architecture. This style, states Harle, is marked by a well proportioned superstructure, its regularly arranged little subordinate sikharas strung out like gigantic beaded garlands.</p>",

  description: "<p class='lead'>Gandhi Hall is a prime example of British influence on Indian architecture in Indore. Originally known as King Edward Hall when it was built in 1904, the monument was renamed to its present title by Yeshwant Rao Holkar (1926-1948) following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. The Hall was designed by a Bombay-based British architect, Charles Frederick Stevens, who imbued the building with an Indo-Gothic style [1]. The material was locally sourced; white sandstone from Seoni and red sandstone from Patan, both in Madhya Pradesh. Interestingly, leftover material from the incomplete Phooti Kothi, also in Indore, was used to construct this hall. The building was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales, George V, in 1905, and in those days, cost Rs 2,50,000 to build. The Hall, which measures 112 feet in length, also features a stage and gallery surrounded by an open verandah, with the four corners of the building meeting at Rajput-style minarets topped with domes, while the entrance is from the south [2]. The surrounding complex also features a children’s park, a temple and a library [3]. The Hall’s high ceiling is remarkable, made of white plaster of paris and painstakingly adorned with gold, with palladian arches, a terraced roof and ornamental moldings adding to the grandeur of the building [4] [5] [6]. However, perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the monument is its clock tower, at a height of ninety feet and capped by a large 15x15 feet dome housing the clock itself [7]. The 116 year old clock tower would chime everyday, playing a major role in Indori life and helping citizens time their activities. The clock stopped chiming about two decades ago, given that the heritage structure was delicate due to lack of upkeep, and the bell’s chiming was considered unsafe due to the vibrations it created, contributing to the deterioration of the building. In 2020, 83 year old watchmaker P.B. Lapalikar, who had repaired the clock in 1956 and 2013 previously, requested the authorities to allow him to restore it once again, and accompanied by his sons and grandson, managed to repair two of them in a week. Anchoring work was carried out in the building to make it safe for the bell to chime, and as of July 2020, the citizens of Indore once again welcomed the sound of the clock ringing every fifteen minutes [8]. Today, the Hall comes under the jurisdiction of the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC). It serves as a popular venue in the city for art and cultural exhibitions and book fairs, and can accommodate up to 2,000 people within the building itself, while the grounds surrounding it can fit many more [9] [10]. It is noticeably lit up with the Indian tri-colour of orange, white and green on national holidays, including Independence Day and Republic Day [11]. However, caretakers and conservationists have repeatedly expressed concern over the neglect and the lack of upkeep of the heritage building; according to some, the ceiling is crumbling and in need of desperate attention, while others feel that the building should be renovated and opened to the public [12].</p>",
